## Technologies :wrench:

- JavaScript <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="15" height="15"/>
- Node.Js  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg" alt="nodejs" width="20" height="20" />

## Overview :sparkler:
An interface that allows the user to register their daily objectives, list them and mark their completion, as well as delete them, when they are no longer useful, through a terminal, such as Git.

## About the development :file_folder:
I developed this project at Rocketseat's NLW Pocket event, which was fundamental for my studies of JavaScript, the programming language I was most dedicated to during that period, enabling me to learn basic and advanced concepts in practice, such as the application of functions, objects and the data capture. Furthermore, I was able to have my first contact with Node.Js and gain greater control over the Git terminal. The week of this event was, for me, certainly an advancement to the next level.

## How to use? :thought_balloon:
If the node files are already installed, simply open the terminal and command the program to start. After that, the interface will be very explanatory and intuitive, and the "space", "enter" and "arrows" keys can be used to select goals, confirm applications and move through the options.

## Features :zap:
- Data capture and storage
- Enables good user interaction
- There are additional notes on the codes used in the development and studied at the event.
